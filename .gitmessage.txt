# [Feature|Improvement|Bugfix] Subject/title (#ISSUE-NUMBER)

# Detailed information about the changes this commit introduces. All information
# should be written in present tense.

# 1.) What will change to the code? E.g.:

# Example:
# --------
# Add a new method '#getChildren(int)' to the interface UserService which allows
# to get all children of an existing user.
#
# Change the two implementation classes UserServiceImpl as well as
# UserServiceRemoteImpl accordingly.

# 2.) Does the change require any updates to the configuration?

# Example:
# --------
# There is a new property 'userservice.enable' in the service configuration. The
# key needs to be added. If it is not available, a ConfigurationException will be
# thrown.

# 3.) Does the change require any updates to the database?

# Example:
# --------
# A new column 'parent' needs to be added to the table 'users'. There's an update
# DDL script for MySQL as well as for Postgres which can both be found under
# 'scripts/ddl/updates/V1_5_0_1__Add_parent_to_users.sql'.
