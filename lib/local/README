This directory is a good place to drop Java libraries (jars) that are used for this special Weblounge instance. Examples of such libraries would be drivers for specific databases or directories.

Note that putting these libraries here is a suggestion and best practice only. 

Libraries that have been put here are not loaded automatically and need to be registered in etc/system.properties with corresponding entries like

# Local libraries.
felix.auto.start.4= \
 file:${weblounge.home}/lib/local/mylibrary-1.0.0.jar
